I wrote my first programs in elementary school using Terrapin Logo, and continued the experience by playing with Lego Mindstorms in middle school. I loved the simplicity of the Mindstorms GUI, and the drag-and-drop capabilities of even the most complicated functions made programming easy, fun and interactive. Recently, I have been thinking about teaching programming and trying to find the perfect tool. Mindstorms is expensive, and Logo is outdated and not eye-catching. MIT's Scratch language comes close to the product I am envisioning so I want to replicate it to understand its nuances. Hopefully I will be able to make it even better.
